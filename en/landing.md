## What you will make

Use Python to draw a target and score points by hitting it with arrows. 

--- print-only ---

![An archery target with a hit point on the outer circle. The text 'You hit the outer circle, 50 points!' is displayed underneath](images/blue-points.png){:width="640px"}

--- /print-only ---

**You will:**
- print() text, including emojis 😃, and get input() ⌨️ from the user
- Store text and numbers in variables
- Use functions to organise your code

--- no-print ---
<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 175px; flex-grow: 1">  

Click the **Run** button below to start the game. When the dot appears on the target 🎯, click the mouse (or tap on your tablet) to fire your arrow.
